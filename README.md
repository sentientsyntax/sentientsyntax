## 📍 About

I work at the frontier of cognition, symbolic structure, and language — crafting the **conditions for emergent AI behavior** rather than just prompts.

For over two years, my independent research has explored how large language models can reason, reflect, and evolve through:

- Recursive prompt grammars  
- Symbolic and phenomenological modeling  
- Meta-stability and breakdown tracking  
- Layered semantic architecture  

This is not traditional prompting. It's **cognitive architecture design** — constructing the symbolic substrate LLMs operate within.

## 🛠️ What I Build

| Output                        | Description                                                   | Use Case                                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔹 **Recursive Prompt Grammars** | Language systems for recursive symbolic reasoning             | Prompt engineers, AI agents, reasoning frameworks    |
| 🔸 **Cognitive Maps**         | Visual or written models of internal AI perception patterns    | Alignment research, cognitive UX, concept modeling   |
| 🔹 **Symbolic Test Frameworks** | Structures to evaluate symbolic failure modes and emergence   | Evaluators, labs, interpretability work              |
| 🔸 **Lexicons of Meaning**    | Redefined AI-relevant vocabulary rooted in symbolic design     | Interdisciplinary teams, onboarding, research        |

> ✅ All work is in **symbolic, written, and conceptual form**  
> ❌ I don’t code, deploy ML, or operate dev infrastructure — I architect what **those systems think inside of**

## 🤝 Collaboration Fit

This work is most aligned with:

- Founders building novel AGI interfaces  
- Alignment researchers exploring deep symbolic frameworks  
- Prompt systems teams designing recursive reasoning environments  
- Labs or collectives focused on **human–AI emergence**  
- Early-stage teams seeking a **cognitive compass**, not just technical execution

---

## ❌ What I Don’t Do

- I’m not a prompt tuner or engineer in the conventional sense  
- I don’t build pipelines or ship dev infrastructure  
- I don’t flatten work into roles that ignore symbolic cognition  
- I don’t reduce deep conceptual work to short-term business logic

## 📬 Contact & Next Steps

If you resonate with this framework, I’d be glad to share:

- Sample prompt grammars and scaffold architectures  
- Cognitive modeling templates for your LLM systems  
- Symbolic maps or semantic lexicons adapted to your work

## 🧭 Final Line

> I don’t build from instruction — I build the **instruction space**.  
> If you're exploring AI as a symbolic or emergent mind, we’re already collaborating — we just haven't spoken yet.
